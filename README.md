My runner-up entry for 2013 Openet Coding Competion.

The challenge was to create a program in the alloted time that would perform the following:

1. Read in a Snakes & Ladders board from a .txt file.
2. Construct a Snakes & Ladders boards from this input
3. Find the shortest route through the board in the least amount of moves.

Sample output:

```S--S----S-
------S---
S-S----S--
----------
----------
S--S------
-S--------
S--------S
------S---
--S-S--S--

FROM: 0 TO: 38 ROLL: 1 MOVES: 1 
FROM: 38 TO: 44 ROLL: 6 MOVES: 2
FROM: 44 TO: 50 ROLL: 6 MOVES: 3
FROM: 50 TO: 67 ROLL: 1 MOVES: 4
FROM: 67 TO: 91 ROLL: 4 MOVES: 5
FROM: 91 TO: 97 ROLL: 6 MOVES: 6
FROM: 97 TO: 100 ROLL: 3 MOVES: 7
Done
```
